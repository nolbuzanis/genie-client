    `Your privacy is important to us. It is Genie's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, http://genieurl.com, and other sites we own and operate.`,
    `We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.`,
    `We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.`,
    `We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.`,
    `We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.`,
    `Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.`,
    `You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.`,
    `Connections with your Spotify account to our service can be disconnected at any time within Spotify itself.`,
    `Genie may change this privacy policy from time to time at Genie’s sole discretion. If you are from the EU, by visiting and using our Website you directly and explicitly agree (opt-in) that your data may be transferred to third countries that DO NOT provide adequate means of data protection. Nevertheless, Genie will take all precautions and relevant measures in order to protect your data according to privacy by default and privacy by design standards. Articles 44-50 of the GDPR cover the specific requirements for transferring personal data to third parties or international organizations. The GDPR does not require that personal data of EU citizens remain exclusively in the EU, but it does have some requirements for such transfers.`,
    `If you are older than 16 years old, you explicitly and directly agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy (as well as any other legal documentation published on this website and updated from time to time) in full. You explicitly and directly warrant and represent that you are at least 16 years old and you are legally capable in full in order to make legally binding actions under your applicable domicile law and under the laws of that jurisdiction where you are currently resided. Otherwise, you explicitly and directly warrant and represent that if you are under 16 years old or possess no legal capability in full in order to make legally binding actions under your applicable domicile law and under the laws of that jurisdiction where you are currently resided, thus, your legal guardian/parent is aware of possible data processing by Genie and your legal guardian/parent has given the consent for data processing on your behalf.`,
    `You explicitly and directly opt-in your consent to receive marketing materials from the Genie and/or its clients (e.g. newsletters, invitations, notices) to my email box.`,
    `You also agree that your email address may be shared with third parties (e.g. artists) while you use services of the Website as it is set in our Terms and Conditions.`,
    `Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.`,
    `This policy is effective as of 26 April 2020.`
